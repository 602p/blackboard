Tool to make wordclouds in the shape of states and assemble them into US maps

##Requirements
Python 3
Pygame
Wordcloud
imagemagick
linux, probably
flask
PIL (or pillow)
PRAW

##Usage
You can use run.sh to generate a big-ol png map, or you can run liveserver.py to constantly refresh the stateclouds and provide a live web visualization at localhost:5000/static/view.htm

I might add some real docs at some point, the whole things pretty quick-and-dirty
